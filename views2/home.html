					<p>Dear participant:</p>

						You and your guardian or NSA (Necessary Supplemental Accommodation) have
						received this link to be completed and submitted to your Employment Specialist.
						These forms and acknowledgments are required to be updated annually for

						with King County and the State of Washington.

					</p>
					<p>
						<u>Release of Information</u>

						This includes your family, guardian, residential program, funding agency,
						case manager, DVR counselor, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						<u>Medical and Emergency Information</u>
						– Please complete fully so SKCAC has
						the
						most current, up-to-date information in case of an emergency. Also please provide updates throughout the year as your medications and other information changes. Providing your e-mail address will help us to provide you with information regarding SKCAC events and updates.
					</p>

						as a participant of our employment services. This list is included in your handbook.

						Social Security benefits at
						<a href="http://www.ssa.gov">www.ssa.gov</a>
						to learn more about how working affects your Social Security benefits.
					</p>
					<p>
						<u>SKCAC Handbook</u>
						– Please acknowledge that you received the handbook, you
						are able to save and print this or request a printed copy be mailed to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						<u>Appeal/Grievance Procedure</u>
						– Please provide your acknowledgment of
						this
						process. The Handbook has this procedure listed.
					</p>
					<p>
						<u>Paystub</u>
						- We need a copy of a recent paystub for employment
						verification,
						please provide that to your Employment Specialist or send a picture of it to
						them via email. If your paycheck is from SKCAC you do not have to provide a copy.
					</p>
					<p>Thank you for taking time to review, complete and return all this information
						through SKCAC’s online process.
						<br />
						We are available to assist you in the process of completing this process.
